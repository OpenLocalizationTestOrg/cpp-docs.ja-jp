# vfscanf_s, vfwscanf_s
Reads formatted data from a stream. These versions of vfscanf, vfwscanf have security enhancements, as described in [Security Features in the CRT](../../c-runtime-library/security-features-in-the-crt.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int vfscanf_s(   
   FILE *stream,  
   const char *format,  
   va_list arglist  
);  
int vfwscanf_s(   
   FILE *stream,  
   const wchar_t *format,  
   va_list arglist  
);  
  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `stream`  
 Pointer to `FILE` structure.  
  
 `format`  
 Format-control string.  
  
 `arglist`  
 Variable argument list.  
  
## Return Value  
 Each of these functions returns the number of fields that are successfully converted and assigned; the return value does not include fields that were read but not assigned. A return value of 0 indicates that no fields were assigned. If an error occurs, or if the end of the file stream is reached before the first conversion, the return value is `EOF` for `vfscanf_s` and `vfwscanf_s`.  
  
 These functions validate their parameters. If `stream` is an invalid file pointer, or `format` is a null pointer, these functions invoke the invalid parameter handler, as described in [Parameter Validation](../../c-runtime-library/parameter-validation.md). If execution is allowed to continue, these functions return `EOF` and set `errno` to `EINVAL`.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `vfscanf_s` function reads data from the current position of `stream` into the locations that are given by the `arglist` argument list (if any). Each argument in the list must be a pointer to a variable of a type that corresponds to a type specifier in `format`. `format` controls the interpretation of the input fields and has the same form and function as the `format` argument for `scanf_s`; see [Format Specification Fields: scanf and wscanf Functions](../../c-runtime-library/format-specification-fields-scanf-and-wscanf-functions.md) for a description of `format`. `vfwscanf_s` is a wide-character version of `vfscanf_s`; the format argument to `vfwscanf_s` is a wide-character string. These functions behave identically if the stream is opened in ANSI mode. `vfscanf_s` doesn't currently support input from a UNICODE stream.  
  
 The main difference between the more secure functions (that have the `_s` suffix) and the other versions is that the more secure functions require the size in characters of each `c`, `C`, `s`, `S`, and `[` type field to be passed as an argument immediately following the variable. For more information, see [scanf_s, _scanf_s_l, wscanf_s, _wscanf_s_l](../../c-runtime-library/reference/scanf-s-scanf-s-l-wscanf-s-wscanf-s-l.md) and [scanf Width Specification](../../c-runtime-library/scanf-width-specification.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The size parameter is of type `unsigned`, not `size_t`.

## Example  
  
```  
// crt_vfscanf_s.c  
// compile with: /W3  
// This program writes formatted  
// data to a file. It then uses vfscanf_s to  
// read the various data back from the file.  
  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <stdarg.h>  
#include <stdlib.h>  
  
FILE *stream;  
  
int call_vfscanf_s(FILE * istream, char * format, ...)  
{  
    int result;  
    va_list arglist;  
    va_start(arglist, format);  
    result = vfscanf_s(istream, format, arglist);  
    va_end(arglist);  
    return result;  
}  
  
int main(void)  
{  
    long l;  
    float fp;  
    char s[81];  
    char c;  
  
    if (fopen_s(&stream, "vfscanf_s.out", "w+") != 0)  
    {  
        printf("The file vfscanf_s.out was not opened\n");  
    }  
    else  
    {  
        fprintf(stream, "%s %ld %f%c", "a-string",  
            65000, 3.14159, 'x');  
        // Security caution!  
        // Beware loading data from a file without confirming its size,  
        // as it may lead to a buffer overrun situation.  
  
        // Set pointer to beginning of file:  
        fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET);  
  
        // Read data back from file:  
        call_vfscanf_s(stream, "%s %ld %f%c", s, _countof(s), &l, &fp, &c, 1);  
  
        // Output data read:   
        printf("%s\n", s);  
        printf("%ld\n", l);  
        printf("%f\n", fp);  
        printf("%c\n", c);  
  
        fclose(stream);  
    }  
}  
  
```  
  
```Output  
a-string  
65000  
3.141590  
x  
```
